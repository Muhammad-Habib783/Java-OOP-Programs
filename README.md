# Java-OOP-Programs
Collection of Java programs demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction.


This repository contains a collection of **Java programs** designed to practice and demonstrate **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.  
It is intended as a learning resource for students, beginners, and anyone who wants to strengthen their understanding of Java OOP fundamentals.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Provide clear examples of **OOP principles** in Java.
- Build small-scale applications that simulate **real-world scenarios**.
- Serve as a **reference library** for assignments, projects, and practice.
- Maintain consistency with the companion repository: [Cpp-OOP-Programs](https://github.com/Muhammad-Habib783/Cpp-OOP-Programs).

---

## 📖 Topics Covered
- **Classes & Objects** – defining and using custom classes.
- **Encapsulation** – using getters/setters to protect data.
- **Inheritance** – single, multilevel, and hierarchical inheritance examples.
- **Polymorphism** – compile-time (method overloading) and runtime (method overriding).
- **Abstraction** – abstract classes and interfaces.
- **Constructors** – default, parameterized, and copy constructors.
- **Packages** – organizing code into reusable modules.
- **Real-world simulations** – banking system, vehicle management, university system, etc.
